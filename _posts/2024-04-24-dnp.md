**ABSTRACT:** For image generation with diffusion models (DMs), a negative prompt __n\*__ can be used to complement the text prompt **p**, helping define properties not desired in the synthesized image. While this improves prompt adherence and image quality, finding good negative prompts is challenging. We argue that this is due to a semantic gap between humans and DMs, which makes good negative prompts for DMs appear unintuitive to humans. To bridge this gap, we propose a new *diffusion-negative prompting* (*DNP*) strategy. *DNP* is based on a new procedure to sample images that are least compliant with **p** under the distribution of the DM, denoted as *diffusion-negative sampling* (*DNS*). Given **p**, one such image is sampled, which is then translated into natural language by the user or a captioning model, to produce the negative prompt __n\*__. The pair (**p**, __n\*__) is finally used to prompt the DM. *DNS* is straightforward to implement and requires no training. Experiments and human evaluations show that *DNP* performs well both quantitatively and qualitatively and can be easily combined with several DM variants.
